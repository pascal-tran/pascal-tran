ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pascal Tran 
I am an industrial engineer/traveller with a wide range of experiences from Humanitarian to Aerospace in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. I decided to dive into data science since 2023 as working with data always felt like a hobby to me. 
I recently got my Data Science certificate in Datacamp and completed a few tracks in Data engineering and Data analysis. 
I want to use github to work on some personal data projects to further develop my skills and hopefully collaborate with some others.
